    1. Definition

        The ROTate ROT128 script encrypts and decrypts a file using the ROT128
        method with the default rotation value or a user-defined one (using
        the ROT128 character set).

        2.1 How to run Python scripts

            All usage examples below show how to execute the Python scripts on
            the shell of a Unix-like system. If you do not know, how to run
            those scripts on your operating system, you may have a look at
            this page:

        2.2 Overview of all command-line arguments

            Usually, each script requires command-line arguments to operate.
            So, to get an overview of all arguments available, simply run the
            script with the "--help" argument. For example:

                $ ./rotate-rot128.py --help

    3. Encrypt a file

        This works as described in section 3 inside the ROT13 documentation,
        but, of course, you need to run the ROTate ROT128 instead of the
        script used there.

    4. Decrypt the file again

        This works as described in section 4 inside the ROT13 documentation,
        but, of course, you need to run the ROTate ROT128 instead of the
        script used there.

    5. User-defined rotation values

        This works as described in section 5 inside the ROT13 documentation,
        but, of course, you need to run the ROTate ROT128 instead of the
        script used there.
