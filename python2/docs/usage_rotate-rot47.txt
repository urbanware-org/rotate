    1. Definition

        The ROTate ROT47 script encrypts and decrypts a file using the ROT47
        method with the default rotation value or a user-defined one (using
        the ROT47 character set).

    2. General stuff

        Usually, each script requires command-line arguments to operate.
        So, to get an overview of all arguments available, simply run the
        script with the "--help" argument. For example:

            $ ./rotate-rot47.py --help

    3. Encrypt a file

        This works as described in section 3 inside the ROT13 documentation,
        but, of course, you need to run the ROTate ROT47 instead of the script
        used there.

    4. Decrypt the file again

        This works as described in section 4 inside the ROT13 documentation,
        but, of course, you need to run the ROTate ROT47 instead of the script
        used there.

    5. User-defined rotation values

        This works as described in section 5 inside the ROT13 documentation,
        but, of course, you need to run the ROTate ROT47 instead of the script
        used there.
